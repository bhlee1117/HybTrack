We provide 3 versions of HybTrack: GUI, script, and compiled standalone versions. The GUI and script versions require MATLAB installation. The compiled standalone version does not need full MATLAB, but just the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). To run HybTrack.exe, please download and install MATLAB R2016b (9.1) Runtime available at https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html.
If you have further questions, please contact bhlee1117@gmail.com.

Thank you for your interest.
