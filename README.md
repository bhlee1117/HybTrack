We provide 3 versions of HybTrack: GUI, script, and compiled standalone versions. The GUI and script versions require MATLAB installation. The compiled standalone version does not need full MATLAB. To run the compiled version for Windows, please install MATLAB R2016b (9.1) Runtime (for Windows). To run the compiled version for Mac, please install MATLAB R2017a (9.2) Runtime (for Mac). MATLAB Runtime can be downloaded from https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html.
